            For my project I was aiming to create a pinball machine, with similar mechanics and looks as one you would find in a arcade like dave and busters. I decided to use a simple pallete for my colors and shapes, I came out with a pac man like look that I really enjoy. I used matter.js to simulate gravity, matter.js was a diffiult extension to grasp but with a few youtube videos I was able to figure out its mechanics to the best of my ability. With the difficulty of adding matter.js to the program, I have also found it extremely rewarding when I succesfully implement certain functions

            this particular video helped me lots with creating bodies

            Explaining, I used bumpers, paddles, and vertice/walls 
            each respectively being bouncers, hitters, and borders for the ball itself
            the goal is to use the paddles by clicking the mouse to hit the ball into blue holes giving you points and seeing how many points you can aqcuire
            I found swinging the paddles to be extremely difficult and I had to have co pilot to assist me with creating hinges that stay stacking for the paddles.
            originally without its help, i had the paddles rotate on a axis in the center of the paddle, which was not what I wanted my project to display.

            I was motivated to attemp a pin ball machine because when you introduced matter.js I started theorizing what i could do inside the program. Pin ball machines are very visually appealing to me and also hold some resonance. I had a pinball machine in my birth home in Clevland Ohio. The machine had to be sold since we moved when I was young. for my project I wish I tried to make small paths the ball could follow that would rack up points for you, but I had to do a simpler approach. one thing I would have change, is trying to make it more visually appearing giveing it flashing lights and maybe noises when you aqcuire points, just like in a arcade game.

            I believe I took my own creative liberty with this, as I have not seen a pin ball machine game like it. I like the art style of certain black and rbg color games for example TOMB OF THE MASK on mobile
            I tried my absolute best to make a realistic flick from a pinball machine, but it did not end up exactly how I wanted. I hope maybe different more experienced coders would be able to percieve my code and vision and expand on it. I had a lot of enjoyment completing the project and it was very gratifying when completed
