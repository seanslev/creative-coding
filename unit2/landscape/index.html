    For my artist statement. I would like to say I attemped a randomly generated forest with random colors giving an abstract sense. The result turn into more of a cave like generation, which I quite enjoy. I placed a tent and lamppost with light being emmitted from the with the transparency function. I like how the generation resembles a checkpoint inside of a cave or dungeon.
