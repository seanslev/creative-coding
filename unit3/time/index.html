            <p>
                My timekeeping piece represents the rhythmic cycles of nature, specifically through the lens of a tree's seasonal transformation. By illustrating how the tree evolves from the lush greens of morning to the stark beauty of a winter night, I explore time as both a universal constant and a deeply personal experience. Each branch and leaf not only tells the time but also reflects our own perceptions and interactions with the world around us. This project aims to evoke contemplation about how we experience time: not merely as a ticking clock, but as a living, breathing phenomenon that shapes our lives and the environment we inhabit.
